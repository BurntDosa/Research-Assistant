## 🚀 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Be Honest
- Don't overestimate resources
- Realistic assessment prevents failure
- It's better to discover issues NOW

### Tip 2: Focus on Critical Gaps
```
🔴 Must Fix:
- No data → Can't start
- No GPU for DL → Can't train

🟡 Can Work Around:
- Low budget → Use free tools
- No team → Take longer solo
```

### Tip 3: Iterate
```
Assessment 1: 45% → Too low
    ↓
Acquire GPU + Find collaborator
    ↓
Assessment 2: 72% → Good!
    ↓
Start project
```

### Tip 4: Use With Gap Analysis
```
Gap Analysis → Find opportunities
    ↓
Feasibility Assessment → Check if doable
    ↓
Choose feasible + interesting gaps
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: What score do I need?
**A**: **70+** is generally good. Context matters (course project vs PhD).

### Q: One resource is red, should I stop?
**A**: Depends which one:
- **Critical** (data, core expertise) → Must fix
- **Nice-to-have** (extra funding) → Can manage

### Q: Got "Not Feasible" but want to proceed?
**A**: Options:
1. Modify project to fit resources
2. Acquire missing resources
3. Do smaller proof-of-concept first
4. Consider different project

### Q: How accurate is this?
**A**: It's a **planning tool**, not a guarantee. Use with:
- Advisor input
- Peer feedback
- Your judgment
