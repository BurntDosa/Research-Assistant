- **Don't underestimate** the project requirements
- Realistic assessment prevents project failure

### 🎯 Focus on Critical Gaps
- Not all gaps are equal
- Prioritize resources that are **absolutely required**
- Some resources can be **substituted or acquired later**

### 🔄 Reassess Regularly
- Resources change over time
- Reassess when:
  - New funding becomes available
  - Team composition changes
  - Timeline shifts significantly
  - Project scope changes

### 💡 Use Recommendations
- The AI provides **specific, actionable** recommendations
- Follow the **priority order** for resource acquisition

1. First: Use **Gap Analysis** to identify research opportunities
2. Then: Use **Feasibility Assessment** to evaluate which opportunities are viable
3. Finally: Choose projects where gaps align with your resources

## Limitations

### What It Can't Do
- **Predict future funding**: Assumes current resources only
- **Guarantee success**: Feasible ≠ guaranteed success

## FAQ

### Q: What's a good feasibility score to proceed?
**A**: Generally, aim for **70+**. But context matters - 60% might be fine for a course project, while 85%+ is better for a PhD dissertation.

### Q: Should I wait until I have all resources?
**A**: No. Projects rated "Feasible" (70-84%) are common. Address critical gaps, but don't wait for perfection.

### Q: The assessment says "Not Feasible" but I want to do this project.
**A**: Consider:
- Can you **acquire the missing resources**?
- Can you **modify the project** to fit your resources?
- Can you do a **scaled-down version** as proof-of-concept?
- Should you **choose a different project** that's more feasible?

### Q: How often should I reassess?
**A**: Reassess when:
- Resources change significantly (new funding, team members)
- Project scope changes
- Timeline shifts
- Quarterly for long-term projects (>1 year)

### Q: Can I get a second opinion?
**A**: Yes! The assessment is a **tool, not a verdict**. Discuss with:
- Advisors/mentors
- Collaborators
- Senior researchers in your field

### Q: What if only one resource is insufficient?
**A**: Depends on which one:
- **Critical resources** (data, time, core expertise) → Must address
- **Nice-to-have resources** (extra funding, equipment) → Can work around

### Q: The AI recommendations seem generic. How do I get specific advice?
**A**: Provide **detailed research description** including:
- Specific methods/techniques
- Data requirements
- Computational needs (model size, training time)
- Domain context
