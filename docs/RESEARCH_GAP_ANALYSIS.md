# üî¨ Research Gap Analysis

**Analysis Date:** 2025-01-12T18:15:30
**Papers Analyzed:** 15
**Research Area:** machine learning in healthcare

## 1. IDENTIFIED GAPS

1. **Limited Real-World Deployment Studies**
   While many papers propose ML models for healthcare, few examine 
   actual deployment challenges, integration with existing systems, 
   or long-term performance in clinical settings.

2. **Lack of Explainability Research**
   Most studies focus on accuracy but neglect interpretability, 
   which is critical for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

   Investigate privacy-preserving ML across multiple hospitals
   to improve model generalization while protecting patient data.

2. **Hybrid Human-AI Decision Making**
   Explore optimal collaboration patterns between clinicians and
   AI systems for diagnostic tasks.

## Best Practices

### üìä Paper Quantity
- **Minimum**: 10 papers for basic analysis
- **Optimal**: 15-20 papers for comprehensive insights
- **Maximum**: System analyzes up to 20 papers (additional papers ignored)

### üéØ Paper Quality
- Include highly-cited papers
- Mix recent and foundational works
- Cover diverse perspectives
- Include review papers when available

### üîÑ Iterative Analysis
1. Conduct initial broad search
2. Run gap analysis
3. Refine search based on identified gaps
4. Run analysis again with new papers
5. Compare results to track evolution

### üí° Combining Features
**Gap Analysis + Literature Review:**
- Run gap analysis first
- Use insights to generate focused literature review
- Review identifies "what we know"
- Gaps identify "what we don't know"

**Gap Analysis + Augmented Search:**
- Identify gaps in initial papers
- Use gap insights to refine search query
- Conduct augmented search for gap-addressing papers
- Compare gap analysis before/after

## Technical Details

### AI Model
- **Engine**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Approach**: Zero-shot analysis with structured prompts
- **Processing**: Analyzes titles, abstracts, keywords from up to 20 papers

### Analysis Process
1. **Paper Summarization**: Extracts key information from each paper
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies themes and trends across papers
3. **Gap Identification**: Uses AI to spot missing elements
4. **Topic Generation**: Synthesizes findings into actionable suggestions
5. **Structured Parsing**: Organizes results into categories

### Output Format
- **Primary**: Markdown-formatted text (copy/paste ready)
- **Sections**: Hierarchical with headers and bullet points
- **Length**: Typically 1000-2000 words
- **Structure**: 5 main sections with 3-10 items each

## Limitations

### Current Constraints
1. **Maximum papers**: Analyzes first 20 papers only
2. **Language**: English papers only

## FAQ

### Q: How is this different from literature review?
**A:** Literature review synthesizes "what we know" from existing papers. Gap analysis identifies "what we don't know" and suggests future directions.

### Q: Can I analyze uploaded PDFs only?
**A:** Yes! The analysis works on any papers in your current collection, including uploaded PDFs.

### Q: How long does analysis take?
**A:** Typically 30-60 seconds depending on number of papers and API response time.

### Q: Can I analyze the same papers multiple times?
**A:** Yes! Each analysis is independent. Useful for comparing with additional papers added later.

### Q: Does it use my saved papers?
**A:** No, it analyzes papers from your current search results (displayed papers). Save functionality is separate.

### Q: What if I get generic results?
**A:** Try:
1. Narrowing your search topic
2. Including more specialized papers
3. Ensuring papers are relevant to a specific aspect

### Q: Can I export the results?
**A:** Currently, copy/paste the markdown text. Direct export coming in future update.
