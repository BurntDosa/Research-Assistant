# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - API KEY COMPROMISED

## üö® Critical Security Issue

Your Google Gemini API key has been exposed publicly on GitHub:

**Exposed Key**: `AIzaSyBQPSOrRrrV13s8xfcQc_ijpIRNBky5lrw`

## ‚úÖ What You MUST Do Right Now

### Step 1: Revoke the Exposed Key (Do This First!)

1. Go to [Google AI Studio API Keys](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Find the key: `AIzaSyBQPSOrRrrV13s8xfcQc_ijpIRNBky5lrw`
4. Click **Delete** or **Revoke**
5. Confirm the deletion

‚è±Ô∏è **Do this within 5 minutes** to minimize risk of abuse.

### Step 2: Generate a New Key

1. While still on the Google AI Studio page
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Copy the new key (it will start with `AIza`)

### Step 3: Update Your Local Configuration

1. Open your `.env` file in this project
2. Replace the old key with your new key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza_YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE"
   ```
3. Save the file

### Step 4: Update Your Repository (Already Done)

‚úÖ The security fixes have been applied to this repository:
- `.gitignore` now blocks all `.env*` files
- Automatic backup creation removed
- Security documentation added

## üìã What Was Fixed

This pull request includes:

1. **`.gitignore` updated**: Now blocks `.env.*` (including `.env.backup`)
2. **`api_key_manager.py` updated**: No longer creates `.env.backup` files
3. **`SECURITY.md` added**: Comprehensive security guidelines
4. **`API_KEY_INCIDENT.md` added**: Detailed incident response guide
5. **`README.md` updated**: Links to security documentation

## üîç Why This Happened

The `api_key_manager.py` file was creating `.env.backup` files to preserve previous configurations. However, these files were not in `.gitignore`, so they could be accidentally committed to git. Once committed, even if deleted, they remain in git history forever.

## ÔøΩÔøΩÔ∏è What to Do Next

1. ‚úÖ Revoke the exposed key (Step 1 above)
2. ‚úÖ Generate and use a new key (Steps 2-3 above)
3. üìñ Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for best practices
4. üîç Check your other projects for similar issues
5. üîí Consider enabling API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Is my account compromised?**
A: Not necessarily, but the API key is. Revoke it immediately to prevent abuse.

**Q: Will my application still work?**
A: Yes, once you update the `.env` file with your new key.

**Q: Do I need to change anything else?**
A: No, just revoke the old key and use the new one.

**Q: Can someone still use the old key?**
A: Not after you revoke it. That's why Step 1 is critical.

## üìû Need Help?

- **Urgent**: Revoke the key first, ask questions later
- **Questions**: See [API_KEY_INCIDENT.md](API_KEY_INCIDENT.md) for detailed FAQ
- **Support**: Open a GitHub Discussion (not an Issue)

## ‚è∞ Timeline

- **Now**: Revoke key immediately
- **Next 5 minutes**: Generate new key and update `.env`
- **Next hour**: Read security documentation
- **Next day**: Review your other projects

---

**Remember**: A compromised API key should always be revoked, never reused. It takes less than 2 minutes to fix this properly.

üîê **Your security is important. Act now.**
