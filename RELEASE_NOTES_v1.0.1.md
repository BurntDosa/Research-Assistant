## ⚠️ Important for Users

### If You Cloned Before This Release:

1. **Regenerate API Keys**: If you had API keys in the repository, regenerate them immediately
2. **Update Your Local Repo**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
3. **Verify .gitignore**: Ensure your `.env` files are properly ignored
4. **Check for Exposed Keys**: Review your commits for any accidentally committed keys

### Best Practices Going Forward:

✅ **DO**: Keep API keys in `.env` file only  
✅ **DO**: Use `.env.example` for templates  
✅ **DO**: Verify `.gitignore` before committing  
❌ **DON'T**: Create backup files of `.env` in the repo  
❌ **DON'T**: Commit any files containing API keys
