## 📝 Notes

### Why v1.0.1?
The v1.0.0 release on GitHub was created before PR #6 was merged. That PR included:
- Critical security documentation
- Important README formatting fixes
- Enhanced .gitignore protection

v1.0.1 ensures users get these important improvements when they download the release package.

### Recommendation
**All users should download v1.0.1** instead of v1.0.0 to get:
- Better security documentation
- Properly formatted README
- Enhanced protection against accidental API key exposure

## 🎯 Next Steps

This PR is ready to merge. After merging:

1. **Optional**: Create a GitHub release for v1.0.1 tag
2. **Optional**: Upload `Research-Assistant-v1.0.1.zip` as a release asset
3. **Optional**: Update release notes to mention v1.0.1 improvements
4. Users can download the ZIP from the repository or GitHub releases
